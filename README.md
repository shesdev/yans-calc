# yans-calc
This is my first ever project uploaded on GitHub!

Hello! As I said, this is my first ever project. Here you can find a simple program which can sum, substract, multiply and divide integers. You can do with it whatever you want. Have fun!

NOTE! You should press "=" button everytime you make an operation otherwise the program will not work properly! Example: to find out how much is "9 + 3 - 2", you should press "9", then "+", then "3", then "=", then "-", then "2" instead of pressing "9", then "+", then "3", then "-", then "2". Maybe i'll fix it later but now there is how it works.

You can contact me via "yansgithub@gmail.com". Bye!
